## Valentines Project

This small project was created with a very special purpose: **to ask my girlfriend to be my Valentine**.

The HTML page in this folder contains a personalized experience designed just for her – a mix of visuals, copy and interactions that express affection in a playful, memorable way. Rather than using a simple message or chat, this project turns the question _“Will you be my Valentine?”_ into a mini web experience.

You can open `index.html` in a browser to see exactly what she saw when you shared it. The code here is not meant to be a full application, but a personal, one‑off gesture built with web technologies.

**Purpose summary:**
- Create a custom web page to ask my girlfriend to be my Valentine.
- Make the moment more meaningful and fun than a typical text message.
- Preserve the memory of that question as a little project in this repo.
